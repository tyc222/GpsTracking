<h4>Location Tracker Application</h4>

<h5>Installation</h5>
- Open this project using Android Studio
- Build this project by connecting your phone to your computer then press the 'run' green arrow button.

<h5>Implementation trade-offs</h5>
Due to time constrains
- Simple architecture without any go to libraries
- Unit test doesn't work correctly, as it is testing against Android api. No mocks were in used
- Simple UI for speed

<h5>Any architectural considerations and reasoning</h5>
- No specific architecture like MVVM or MVI, if it was a commercial project might leverage on VM and Livedata for business logic and UI change
- Main functions are in a single activity with a utility class, as this is a poc

<h5>Your areas of focus, and anything you would like to draw our attention to</h5>
- Demonstrates all functions are working and what a unit test would look like

<h4>Any copied code, references and 3rd party libraries</h5>
- All gps related code where found in Google's documentation

<h5>How long you worked on the app for</h5>
- Because I was working on this after working hours, so I had people come and talk to me. Give or take, around 4 hours

<h5>Anything else you want us to know</h5>
- Please be mindful this is a poc, so I chose to use Android api to do distance calculation therefore unit test doesn't fully work. However, in a commercial project a mock would be used.
